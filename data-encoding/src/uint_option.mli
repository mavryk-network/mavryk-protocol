(** Like most other [.mli] files in this directory, this is not intended for
    end-users. Instead, the interface from this file is used internally to
    assemble the end-user-intended module {!Data_encoding}. Refer to that module
    for documentation. *)

(**

   Optional non-negative integers can be represented by an [int]
   provided that [None] is encoded as [-1] and [Some x] is encoded by
   [x]. This module provides a type abstraction to maintain this
   invariant.

   This optimized representation avoids the allocation of a block in
   the heap and also removes one indirection when reading such an
   optional non-negative integer.

   @raise [Assert_failure] when assumptions are broken. This module is meant to
   be used internally only, covered by an extensive test-suite with assertion
   checks on, and packaged with assertion checks off.
