(** [blit_instructions_seq_of_jsonm_lexeme_seq ~newline ~buffer json]
    is a sequence of [(buff, offset, length)] such that the concatenation of the
    sub-strings thus designated represents the json value in text form.

    The intended use is to blit each of the substring onto whatever output the
    consumer decides. In most cases, the Sequence's [buff] is physically equal
    to [buffer]. This is not always true and one cannot rely on that fact. E.g.,
    when the json includes a long string literal, the function might instruct
    the consumer to blit from that literal directly.

    This function performs few allocations, especially of fresh strings.

    Note that once the next element of the sequence is forced, the blit
    instructions become invalid: the content of [buff] may have been rewritten
    by the side effect of forcing the next element.

    @raise Invalid_argument if [Bytes.length buffer] is less than 32. *)
