      [register ?variables name rule] will register a pipeline [name]

      If [jobs] is not set, then the pipeline is a legacy, hand-written

(** A facility for registering images for [image:] keywords.

(** A job dependency.

    - A job that depends on [Job j] will not start until [j] finishes.

    - A job that depends on [Optional j] will not start until [j]
    finishes, if it is present in the pipeline. For more information,
    see
    {{:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#needsoptional}needs:optional}.

      and will also have the artefacts of [j] available. *)

(** Job dependencies.

    - A [Staged artifact_deps] job implements the default GitLab CI behavior of
      running once all jobs in the previous stage have terminated. Artifacts are
      downloaded from the list of jobs in [artifact_deps] (by default, no
      artifacts are downloaded).
    - An [Dependent deps] job runs once all the jobs in [deps] have terminated.
      To have a job run immediately, set [Dependent []]

    In practice, prefer using [Dependent]. Only use [Staged
    artifact_deps] when the number of dependencies exceed the GitLab
    imposed limit of 50 [needs:] per job. *)
type dependencies = Staged of tezos_job list | Dependent of dependency list

(** Values for the [GIT_STRATEGY] variable.

    This can be used to specify whether a job should [Fetch] or [Clone]
    the git repository, or not get it at all with [No_strategy].

    For more information, see
   {{:https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/configure_runners.html#git-strategy}GIT_STRATEGY} *)

  | Fetch  (** Translates to [fetch]. *)
  | Clone  (** Translates to [clone]. *)

          Renamed to avoid clashes with {!Option.None}. *)

(** GitLab CI/CD YAML representation of [git_strategy].

    Translates {!git_strategy} to values of accepted by the GitLab
    CI/CD YAML variable [GIT_STRATEGY]. *)
val enc_git_strategy : git_strategy -> string

(** Define a job.

    This smart constructor for {!Gitlab_ci.Types.job} additionally:

    - Translates each {!dependency} to [needs:] and [dependencies:]
    keywords as detailed in the documentation of {!dependency}.
    - Adds [tags:] based on [arch] and [tags]:

      - If only [arch] is set to [Amd64] (resp. [Arm64]) then the tag
        ["gcp"] (resp ["gcp_arm64"]) is set.
      - If only [tags] is set, then it is passed as is to the job's [tags:]
        field.
      - Setting both [arch] and [tags] throws an error.
      - Omitting both [arch] and [tags] is equivalent to setting
        [~arch:Amd64] and omitting [tags].

    - Throws a run-time error if both [rules] and [when_] are passed. A
     [when_] field can always be represented by [rules] instead, so use
     the latter for more complex conditions. *)

(** Generates a job to an external file.

    This function is meant to be used in the transition to CI-in-OCaml.
    It writes {!header} and the given job to the destination path
    [.gitlab/ci/jobs/DIRECTORY/NAME(-FILENAME_SUFFIX).yml].
    Directory defaults to the stage name if not set.

    This allows migrating all the jobs of a given pipeline, and
    including the generated definition of those jobs in other
    pipelines where it appears.

    Raises [Failure] if [.gitlab/ci/jobs/DIRECTORY] is not an existing
    directory. Also [Failure] if destination path has already been
    used to write another job.

    The returned job is the same as the input, for ease of chaining. *)
val job_external :
  ?directory:string -> ?filename_suffix:string -> tezos_job -> tezos_job

(** Generates a set of jobs to the same external file.

    This function is meant to be used in the transition to CI-in-OCaml.
    It writes {!header} and the given jobs to the file
    [.gitlab/ci/jobs/PATH].

    The use case is the same as [job_external] but for cases where it
    is impractical to split a set of jobs into one file per job
    (e.g. opam package test jobs).

    The returned set of jobs is the same as the input, for ease of
    chaining. *)
val jobs_external : path:string -> tezos_job list -> tezos_job list

(** Adds artifacts to a job without overriding, if possible, existing artifacts.

    - If the job already has an artifact with [old_name] and [name] is given, then
      [name] is used.
    - If the job already has an artifact exposed as [old_exposed_as] and
      [exposed_as] is given, then [exposed_as] is used.
    - If the job already has an artifact added [old_when] and
      [when_] is given, the new artifact will be added:
        - at [old_when] if [old_when = when_]
        - at [Always] if [old_when <> when_]
    - If the job already has an artifact that expires in [old_expires_in] and
      [expires_in] is given, then the largest of the two durations is used. Note
      that for the purpose of this comparison, we consider that a minute is 60
      seconds, that an hour is 60 minutes, that a week is 7 days, that a
      month is 31 days, and that a year is 365 days.
    - Individual fields of a {!report} cannot be combined: a run-time error is
      raised if [reports] contains a report that is already set in the job.
    - [paths] are appended to the set of paths in [job]. *)
