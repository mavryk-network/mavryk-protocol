     We have two concise ways to refer to a slot:

     - a commitment uniquely identifies the content of the slot, it is
       useful to prove properties about the slot length and the shards.

     - a slot identifier gives at which level and at which index the
       slot was published. It only makes sense for slots which have been
       published in some block or at least whose publication in a block
       has been attempted.

     The Irmin part of the store provides a bidirectional mapping
     between commitments and slot identifiers, it also maps to these
     identifiers the following pieces of information:

     - the content of the slot,
     - the status of the publication operation (accepted or not),
     - the attestation status (see Types.header_status).

  (** [add_slot_by_commitment store cryptobox slot_content commitment]
      adds a mapping from the given commitment to the given slot
      content. The given cryptobox is only used to get the size of the
      slot content, no cryptographic verification is performed by this
      function. *)
