(** [with_amplification_lock ready_ctxt slot_id ~on_error f] returns
    nothing if the amplification lock for [slot_id] is already taken,
    otherwise it aquires the lock and starts the [f ()] promise
    without waiting for its resolution.

    The promise can either succeed, return an error, or raise an
    exception. In any case, the amplification lock is released after
    the completion of the promise.

    If the promise returns an error, the error is passed to the
    [on_error] handler after the release of the lock.

    If the promise raises an exception, it is turned into an error
    using [Error_monad.fail_with_exn] and passed to the [on_error]
    handler after the release of the lock. *)
