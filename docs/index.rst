**Never heard of Mavkit?** Let's get acquainted!

Mavkit & the Mavryk protocol are an implementation of the `Mavryk blockchain <https://mavryk.org>`__ , a
distributed consensus platform with meta-consensus
capability.

This means that, unlike other blockchains like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Mavryk comes to consensus not only about the state of its ledger, but also about how the protocol and the nodes should adapt and upgrade.

This is a fundamental design choice, allowing Mavryk to be seamlessly upgradable and continuosly evolving.
Due to this feature, Mavryk is built to last, and always stay at the leading edge of blockchain technology.

To learn more about Mavryk, the `Mavryk documentation <https://mavryk.org>`__.

To learn more about how Mavkit & the protocol fit into Mavryk and its ecosystem, see :doc:`introduction/mavryk`.

**Newcomer to Mavkit?** Start participating to Mavryk using Mavkit!

Start participating to Mavryk by following the ``Introduction`` section in the documentation menu.

These tutorials explain:

- how to :doc:`get the latest release of Mavkit <introduction/howtoget>` (a complete, open-source implementation of Mavryk) in various forms,
- how to :doc:`start using Mavkit to join Mavryk <introduction/howtouse>`,
- different :doc:`ways to participate to the network <introduction/howtorun>`,

and more.

**Already a user?** Here is everything you need to know!

If you already installed Mavkit and can participate in the Mavryk blockchain, the most useful resources are grouped in the ``User manual`` section in the documentation menu.
These pages:

- present the key concepts and mechanisms for setting up Mavkit, including :doc:`user/setup-client`, :doc:`user/setup-node`, for different production or testing configurations;
- empowers you to take advantage of Mavkit' basic and more advanced features, such as :doc:`user/key-management`, :doc:`user/multisig`, :doc:`user/logging`, and much more.

If you intend to participate to Mavryk not just as a user, but rather as a baker, you should also check more specialized documentation such as the  `Baking section on the Mavryk Documentation <https://documentation.mavryk.org/node-baking/overview/>`__.

**Want to know how it works?** It's no secret, let us explain!

If you want to know more about the *technology* underlying Mavkit and the Mavryk protocol, the ``Reference manual`` section in the documentation present their rationale, main design principles, and some high-level implementation principles:

- Page ``Mavkit software architecture`` explains how the :ref:`architecture of the Mavkit implementation <packages>` instantiates the high-level :ref:`architectural principles of any Mavryk implementation <the_big_picture>`, consisting in a "shell" and a "protocol" .

- Page ``Mavkit Shell`` details some major subsystems of :doc:`shell/shell`.

- Page ``Mavkit Protocol`` explains the design principles and the salient features of the Mavryk protocol. In fact, these pages are versioned for several Mavryk protocols, current or upcoming, such as: the :doc:`active protocol <active/protocol>`, a :doc:`protocol proposal under development <alpha/protocol>`, and possibly some protocol(s) that are currently candidate(s) for future adoption.

- Other pages are related to the important Smart Rollups feature, and present tools such as the Smart rollup node and Data Availability Committees.

**Are you a Mavryk developer?** Find here some useful reference pages!

If you are a developer on the Mavryk platform, you must know the `Mavryk Developer Portal <https://mavryk.org/developers/>`__ or `Open Mavryk <https://openmavryk.org>`__, giving accessible and pedagogical expositions on how to write smart contracts or Dapps.

This website complements those resources with reference documentation, mostly in section ``Developer reference``, including:

- Principles of the RPC interface such as the :doc:`developer/rpc`
- RPC references such as :doc:`shell/rpc`, :doc:`api/openapi`, or :doc:`api/errors`
- A complete reference of :doc:`active/michelson`
- Guidelines for writing smart contracts in Michelson, such as :doc:`active/michelson_anti_patterns`.

**Are you a platform developer?** Here are the nuts and bolts!

One major focus of this website is on resources for platform developers, that is, contributors to Mavkit (Mavkit developers) and contributors to the Mavryk protocol (protocol developers).

Platform developers can find a rich set of explanations, tutorials, and howtos, mainly in the ``Contributing`` section, including:

- a tutorial on the various forms of contributing (:doc:`developer/contributing`), and guidelines such as :doc:`developer/guidelines`
- programming tutorials covering various libraries and frameworks specific to the Mavkit OCaml implementation, such as using :doc:`developer/gadt`, using :doc:`developer/error_monad`, using :doc:`developer/clic`, :doc:`developer/event_logging_framework`, etc.
- howtos for specific maintenance tasks such as :doc:`developer/michelson_instructions`, :doc:`developer/protocol_environment_upgrade`, or :doc:`developer/howto-freeze-protocols`
- a whole subsection on the :doc:`various testing frameworks <developer/testing_index>` for Mavkit, explaining how to use them and how to add different kinds of tests
- presentations of various tools for platform developers, such as support for :doc:`developer/profiling` and :doc:`developer/snoop`.

Platform developers are also provided reference materials for internal APIs of Mavkit, such as:

- The :doc:`API of OCaml libraries and modules <api/api-inline>` reference
- The :doc:`shell/p2p_api` reference
- The :doc:`developer/merkle-proof-encoding-formats` reference.
