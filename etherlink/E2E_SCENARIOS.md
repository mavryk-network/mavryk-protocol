Milestone: https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/milestones/310#end-to-end-real-world-scenarios
Repo: https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/tree/main

## Scenario 1: ERC-20 (token)

Basic scenario for using the ERC-20 token: cryptocurrency.

The code for the actions can be found in [BasicTestToken.ts](https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/blob/main/test/ERC20/BasicTestToken.ts).

### Actions:

 1. Owner can create tokens
    * The creation event is emitted
    * The owner balance is increased
 2. Non-owner can't create tokens
    * Revert
    * The revert message should be compatible: [#6744](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/issues/6744)
    * The non-owner balance is not increased
 3. Owner can burn tokens
    * The burn event is emitted
    * The owner balance is decreased
 4. Non-owner can't burn tokens
    * Revert
    * The revert message should be compatible: [#6744](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/issues/6744)
    * The non-owner balance is not decreased
 5. Usage of the permit protocol (EIP-2612)
    * First user sign an ERC2612 permission off-chain
    * Second user can use permit and transfer tokens from first user
    * Balance of the second user increased

### Executing scenario

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/tree/main#tests) specialized with the ERC-20 test.
* Local: `npx hardhat test test/ERC20/BasicTestToken.ts`.
* Ghostnet: `npx hardhat test --network etherlink test/ERC20/BasicTestToken.ts`.

## Scenario 2: ERC-721 (NFT)

Basic scenario for using the ERC-721 token: NFT (Non-Fungible Token).

The code for the scenario can be found in [BasicNFT.sol](https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/blob/main/contracts/ERC721/BasicNFT.sol).

### Actions

1. Owner can create a token
    * The creation event is emitted
    * The owner balance is increased
2. Owner can transfer a token
    * The transfer event is emitted
    * The receiver balance is increased
    * The sender balance is decreased

The code for the actions can be found in [BasicNFT.ts](https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/blob/main/test/ERC721/BasicNFT.ts).

### Testing

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/tree/main#tests) specialized with the ERC-721 test.

* Local: `npx hardhat test test/ERC721/BasicNFT.ts`.
* Ghostnet: `npx hardhat test --network etherlink test/ERC721/BasicNFT.ts`.

## Scenario 3: ERC-1967 (transparent proxy pattern)

Basic scenario for using the [ERC-1967](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967): the transparent proxy pattern by Openzeppelin.

The code for the scenario can be found in [Logic_positive.sol](https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/blob/main/contracts/proxies/transparent/Logic_positive.sol) and [Logic_negative.sol](https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/blob/main/contracts/proxies/transparent/Logic_negative.sol).

This is almost the same code but with a small difference: one increase the storage, the other decrease it. The goal is to use them to test the proxy system and "upgrade" it by switching between these 2 versions.

### Actions:
1. Deployment of Transparent Proxy Pattern
   * The proxy (storage) contract is deployed by the Openzeppelin's plugin
   * The implementation (logic) contract is deployed by the Openzeppelin's plugin
   * The admin (manage upgrade) contract is deployed by the Openzeppelin's plugin
2. Delegate calls works
   * The number in the proxy (storage) is modify
   * The number in the implementation (logic) is not modify
3. Upgrade version on Transparent Proxy
   * The proxy contract address is the same after upgrade
   * The proxy contract storage is the same after upgrade
   * The implementation (logic) contract is the new version
4. Delegate calls works after upgrade
   * The number in the proxy (storage) is modify by the new version
   * The number in the implementation (logic) is not modify

The code for the actions can be found in [logicPositiveAndNegative.ts](https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/blob/main/test/proxies/transparent/logicPositiveAndNegative.ts).

The code for the deployment using Openzeppelin's plugin can be found in [01-deploy-proxyLogicPositive.ts](https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/blob/main/deploy/proxies/transparent/01-deploy-proxyLogicPositive.ts).

Important to know:
- The objective here is to test a proxy system. These proxies rely on a logic contract (also known as implementation contract or master copy) that is called using delegatecall. This allows proxies to keep a persistent state (storage and balance) while the code is delegated to the logic contract.
- The deployment process is also important here because the tool do not simply deploy the smart contract used for the test. Instead, the plugin deploy 3 different contracts: the Admin, the Proxy and the Logic. The Admin is responsible for the upgrade part. The Proxy is the contract storing all the modification and sending the request with delegatecall and the Logic is the contract containing the logic itself and will be called by the Proxy to modify directly it storage.

### Testing

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/tree/main#tests) specialized with the ERC-1967 test.
* Local: `npx hardhat test test/proxies/transparent/logicPositiveAndNegative.ts`.
* Ghostnet: `npx hardhat test --network etherlink test/proxies/transparent/logicPositiveAndNegative.ts`.

The test should go through, even if the interaction actually fails because of some issues in Etherlink, not the scenario. (Fixing Etherlink would be the purpose of the next task.)

## Scenario 4: conventional NFT dApp

Basic scenario of an NFT dApp using Etherlink as blockchain layer.

The code for the dApp used in the scenario can be found in [here](https://github.com/Camillebzd/nft_marketplace_alchemy_rtw3_7) and the live website can be be found [here](https://nft-marketplace-alchemy-rtw3-7-etherlink-nightly.vercel.app/).

The code of the Marketplace contract is in [NFTMarketplace.sol](https://github.com/Camillebzd/nft_marketplace_alchemy_rtw3_7/blob/main/contracts/NFTMarketplace.sol) and it is deployed with [deploy.js](https://github.com/Camillebzd/nft_marketplace_alchemy_rtw3_7/blob/main/scripts/deploy.js).

### Actions:
0. Developer can use the Marketplace contract
   * Developer can deploy the contract on any EVM chains (using hardhat tool)
   * Developer can connect the Marketplace easily by changing only the connection button to fit the network
1. Users can connect their Metamask wallet to see the list of the NFTs and interact with the dApp
   * Basic connection between the Metamask and the dApp
   * Add and/or switch the good network setup for the dApp (Nightly or Etherlink ghostnet)
2. Users can create a token and list it on the dApp
   * The token is created with the good URL (the good image, name, price and description)
   * The owner can see the NFT on his profile and on the explorer
3. Users can buy listed tokens on the dApp
   * Select a token listed on the Marketplace and make a transaction to buy it
   * The new owner can see it on his profile and on the explorer

Except for the 0., these actions need to be done manually directly on the dApp either locally or on the [live website](https://nft-marketplace-alchemy-rtw3-7-etherlink-nightly.vercel.app). 

Action 0. concerns the deployment of the marketplace and need only to be done once. It has been validated by @camille.bouzerand by deploying the live website. 

### Testing

I recommend testing the dApp directly on the [live website](https://nft-marketplace-alchemy-rtw3-7-etherlink-nightly.vercel.app). Otherwise, you will need to follow the instructions to run it locally like described [here](https://github.com/Camillebzd/nft_marketplace_alchemy_rtw3_7?tab=readme-ov-file#setup). :warning: If you run it locally, you will need to create a [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) account and an API key.

## Scenario 5: the Uniswap v2 DeFi protocol
Deploy and test the basic use of Uniswap v2 on Etherlink.

**What is Uniswap?**
Uniswap V2 is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain (so compatible with EVM chains). It allows users to swap various ERC-20 tokens directly without the need for intermediaries. The protocol works thanks to AMMs (Automated Market Maker system) that are represented as "pools" or "pairs". These liquidity pools are autonomous and are filled or emptied by users. Each pool is made up of 2 tokens and you can interact with them to exchange one of the two tokens for the other.

**Why this scenario?**
The goal of this scenario is to test a complete DeFi protocol on Etherlink. Uniswap v2 was chosen because it is one of the most robust and most used in the Ethereum environment. This means that if it works correctly on Etherlink, we greatly increase our credibility on the subject of compatibility but also on the fact of being able to support advanced DeFi protocols.

**Technical details**
The contract part used here is a complete fork of Uniswap v2. It is made up of 2 parts: the first called core contains the factory which creates the pairs and the second called periphery contains a number of tools to facilitate interactions with these pairs. Besides the deployment and creation of the pair itself, we test here the 3 main actions that a user can do: a swap, add liquidity or remove liquidity.
Each test here is intended to be "standalone", meaning you don't need to run them in a specific order or even run them all, each test takes care of adding or removing liquidity if needed.

The code for the scenario is a fork of [v2-core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core) and [v2-periphery](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery), and can be found [here](https://github.com/trilitech/uniswap-v2-fork/tree/main/contracts).

### Actions:
0. User can deploy the Uniswap v2 protocol
    * User can deploy the core
    * User can deploy the periphery
1. User can setup the Uniswap v2 protocol
    * User can create 2 tokens (optionnal)
    * User can create a Pair
2. User can swap tokens using the Router
    * User can swap the token0 to receive the token1 from the Pair using the Router
    * Router handle all the process and emit the events correctly
3. User can add liquidity using the Router
    * User can add liquidity (token0 and token1) in the Pair using the Router
    * User receive LP tokens proportionally to the liquidity added
    * Router handle all the process and emit the events correctly
4. User can remove liquidity using the Router
    * User can remove liquidity (token0 and token1) in the Pair using the Router
    * User loose LP tokens proportionally to the liquidity removed
    * Router handle all the process and emit the events correctly

The code for the Actions can be found in [UniswapV2Router02.ts](https://github.com/trilitech/uniswap-v2-fork/blob/main/test/periphery/UniswapV2Router02.ts).

### Test

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/trilitech/uniswap-v2-fork/blob/main/README.md) to deploy and test the Actions.

## Scenario 6: interactions with Foundry

Basic scenario using a simple Counter contract to test the deployment and interaction between Foundry and Etherlink.

Foundry is a development platform that simplifies the process of building and deploying decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides developers with a suite of tools and features to streamline smart contract development, testing, deployment, and interaction with Ethereum networks. The deployments and tests are made directly in solidity. It countains several tools such as `forge` to compile, deploy and test, and `cast` to interact with the blockchains (testnets and mainnets). It also contains features to facilitate advanced tests and audits like fuzzing. You can find everything in [the foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

The code for the scenario can be found in [Counter.sol](https://github.com/trilitech/development-tools-compatibility-etherlink/blob/main/foundry/src/Counter.sol).

### Actions:
1. User can deploy the Counter using `forge`
   * The contract is deployed on Etherlink
   * User can see the contract address and transaction hash
2. User can verify the Counter using `forge`
   * User can verify the contract
   * User can see the contract verified on Blockscout
3. User can check the value in the Counter using `cast`
   * User can make a request to see the value in the Counter
4. User can increment the value in the Counter using `cast`
   * User can make a transaction to increment the value in the Counter by 1
5. User can set the value in the Counter using `cast`
   * User can make a transaction to set the value in the Counter
6. User can use the tool in an error situation using `cast`
   * User can make a transaction revert
   * The tool handle correctly the response from the node (no crash and/or error well parsed)

The code for the deployment can be found in [Counter.s.sol](https://github.com/trilitech/development-tools-compatibility-etherlink/blob/main/foundry/script/Counter.s.sol). For all actions, different cli tools (namely `forge` and `cast`) are used to interact with Etherlink. See Testing for the commands.

### Testing

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/trilitech/development-tools-compatibility-etherlink/tree/main/foundry#deploy-the-contract-and-run-some-tests-on-etherlink) to deploy and test the Actions with the tool.

The test should go through, even if the interaction actually fails because of some issues in Etherlink, not the scenario. (Fixing Etherlink would be the purpose of the next task.)

### Special note

As Etherlink do not support EIP-1559 for the moment, all the interactions using Foundry are runned with the `--legacy` flag.

## Scenario 7: interactions with Hardhat

Basic scenario using a simple Counter contract to test the deployment and interaction between Hardhat and Etherlink.

Hardhat is a development environment tailored for Ethereum and EVM compatible chains, streamlining smart contract development, testing, and deployment. It offers a simple setup for writing contracts in Solidity, built-in tasks for compiling, testing, and deploying contracts, and seamless integration with Ethereum networks. With debugging tools, scriptable deployment, and extensibility through plugins, Hardhat accelerates Ethereum development with efficiency and reliability. The language used with the tool is Javascript/Typescript.

The scenarios 1, 2 and 3 are using hardhat but the interactions are tested with the hardhat-deploy plugin and with the test system. Here we use [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6) lib which is integrated by hardhat by default for the communication with the RPC node and openzeppelin [hardhat-upgrades](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades) plugin used for proxy interaction. The interactions are made directly in simple script files to easily control hardhat calls.

The code for the scenario can be found in [Counter.sol](https://github.com/trilitech/development-tools-compatibility-etherlink/blob/main/hardhat/contracts/Counter.sol).

### Actions:

1. User can deploy the Counter
   * The contract is deployed on Etherlink
   * User can see the contract address
2. User can verify the Counter
   * User can verify the contract
   * User can see the contract verified on Blockscout
3. User can increment the value in the Counter
   * User can make a transaction to increment the value in the Counter by 1
   * User can see the value in the Counter before and after the transaction
4. User can set the value in the Counter
   * User can make a transaction to set the value in the Counter
   * User can see the value in the Counter before and after the transaction
5. User can use the tool in an error situation
   * User can cause a transaction to revert
   * The tool handle correctly the response from the node (no crash and/or error well parsed)
6. User can use the tool with openzeppelin [hardhat-upgrades](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-upgrades) plugin
   * User can deploy the counter with a proxy
   * User can see in the console the addresses of the proxy, the implementation and the admin parts

The code for the Actions can be found in the [scripts/](https://github.com/trilitech/development-tools-compatibility-etherlink/tree/main/hardhat/scripts) folder.

### Testing

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/trilitech/development-tools-compatibility-etherlink/blob/main/hardhat/README.md#deploy-the-contract-and-run-some-tests-on-etherlink) to deploy and test the Actions with the tool.

### Special note

We also test Ethers.js because Hardhat use directly this library.

## Scenario 8: interactions with Remix

Basic scenario using a simple Counter contract to test the deployment and interaction between Remix and Etherlink.

Remix is a powerful web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Ethereum smart contract development. It offers a user-friendly interface for writing, compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts directly from the browser. Remix simplifies Ethereum development with features such as real-time compilation, debugging tools, built-in testing capabilities, and seamless integration with Ethereum networks. With Remix, developers can rapidly prototype, iterate, and deploy smart contracts without the need for additional setup or installations.

The code for the scenario can be found in [Counter.sol](https://github.com/trilitech/development-tools-compatibility-etherlink/blob/main/remix/Counter.sol).

### Actions:

1. User can deploy the Counter
   * The contract is deployed on Etherlink
   * User can see the contract address
2. User can check the value in the Counter
   * User can make a request to see the value in the Counter
3. User can increment the value in the Counter
   * User can make a transaction to increment the value in the Counter by 1
4. User can set the value in the Counter
   * User can make a transaction to set the value in the Counter
5. User can use the tool in an error situation
   * User can cause a transaction to revert
   * The tool handle correctly the response from the node (no crash and/or error well parsed)

There is no code for the Actions as Remix is a graphical IDE, everything must be done manually on it.

### Manually testing the MR


Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/trilitech/development-tools-compatibility-etherlink/blob/main/remix/README.md#remix) to deploy and test the Actions with the tool.

**Important:** when you will test the `revertMe` method on the contract, be sure to set the second argument to 0 for the method to revert.

### Special note

You also realize some tests with MetaMask tool because you need it to link Remix with Etherlink.

## Scenario 9: interactions with MetaMask

Basic scenario using MetaMask wallet to send transactions on the Etherlink network.

There is no code for this specific scenario.

### Actions:
1. User can use the Etherlink network on MetaMask
   * The Etherlink network can be added directly on MetaMask
   * User can see his balance of XTZ on the wallet
2. User can send simple transactions
   * User can send to himself (or somebody else) some XTZ from the MetaMask interface
   * User can see his transaction on the Blockscout explorer
3. User can use MetaMask on a dApp with Etherlink network
   * User can connect on a dApp (I recommend Blockscout or the dApp form scenario 4) with MetaMask
   * User can interact with the dApp and send transactions
4. Metamask handle correctly failed transactions on Etherlink network
   * User can send a transaction that will failed with MetaMask on Etherlink
   * User can then send an other transaction as for the steps above and it will works correctly

There is no code for the Actions.

### Test

Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/trilitech/development-tools-compatibility-etherlink/blob/main/metamask/README.md#tests) to help you setup and pass the Actions.

## Scenario 10: interactions with ThirdWeb
